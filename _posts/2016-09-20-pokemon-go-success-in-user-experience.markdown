<blockquote>TL;DR; I did a scientific research that proves that Augmented Reality games have superior user experience when compared to the Virtual Realty games. Therefore, It can be argued that part of the success of Pokemon Go is backed also by the highly positive experiences that usage of the augmented reality game evokes.</blockquote>

<p>Even though I’ve known about Pokemon GO before its release I could have never imagined the craze that it will cause. As I worked with Augmented Reality (AR), I had the feeling that AR is going to hit hard one day and that day is going to happen soon. And this is exactly what happened just a few weeks back and unless you have been tied somewhere indoors without the internet access there is a little chance that you missed this whole poke-madness.</p>

<p>As a graduate student myself, I have taken multiple courses on Augmented and Virtual reality. 
My journey with virtual worlds started last year in Netherlands when I got my hands on Oculus Rift. After some crazy brainstorming sessions where we discussed how awesome would it be to simulate some breathtaking experiences that very few people have actually experienced.</p>

<p>The project started to move in a bit morbid direction when we discussed about creation of a <a href="https://youtu.be/dfwtyCFDRPw" target="_blank">guillotine simulator</a>, however, a desk search revealed that there are still some more weird people like us and that the similar project has already been made.</p>

<p>After this discovery our feelings were mixed, however, soon we realized that it was actually a good thing and that nobody actually wants to have a bullet point about creating a execution simulator in their CV. </p>

<p>In the end we created a two person multiplayer game where one player is in the cockpit of a russian plane and after a bottle of vodka and a couple of hours of sleep he wakes up in front of some siberian airport and has to land a plane. His task is to land a plane while executing various tasks while communicating with the second player over headphones who actually plays a role of a air traffic controller. </p>


<p>To successfully land a plane he needs to first communicate the model of the aircraft to the control tower player (model number was behind him and in Cyrillic xD). Next, with the help of leap motion, the pilot player uses its real hands to interact with virtual objects in order to do things such us turning off the autopilot and adjusting different knobs on the cockpit dashboard. We received the highest grade for our project and showcased it at the university’s Demo-Day. Even though the tasks sound relatively easy, most of the people didn't manage to land it and instead, ended up crashing in the mountain or in a cockpit fire. If you did land successfully you were awarded with a pilot certificate and a shot of vodka at our presentation table.</p>


<p>Albeit, its time to get back to the actual topic of this post. Later that year, when I started experimenting with Augmented Reality I was wondering how different actually people perceive it in regards to the Virtual environments. Although my hunch was that people might enjoy augmented worlds even more than completely virtual ones, I had to do something for my Master thesis and decided to answer this question and back it up with some scientific evidence.</p>

<p>And this is exactly what I did. I created two versions of the same game and asked people to play both of them for couple of minutes in both Augmented and Virtual reality environment.  The game itself was a 2-player multiplayer where the goal is to beat your opponent while navigating the virtual helicopter.  While doing so,  different power-ups or power-downs will spawn in mid-air which if collected will allow you to shoot your opponent with different weapons or even damage your own health. The relationship between weapons and power-ups as well as other information related to the game play is the following:</p>

<p>To answer the question of which environment the people enjoy more (AR or the VR) I first had to rephrase the question. The proper way to ask it is does any of the two game environments provides a better user experience?</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Augmented Reality version of my Helicopters Game (Note that the game is multiplayer and the players are sitting opposite of each other).</span>

<p>After I gathered data from 26 people, half of the people played VR version first and half of the people played the AR game version first. Results showed up to be very interesting. However, it is important to note that the User Experience is a very complex topic and involves high number of parameters that are almost impossible to cover in a single study.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, in most of the cases people will agree that the User Experience is comprised of the following four components:</p>

<a >
    <center><img width="70%" height="70%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/UserExperience.jpg" alt="Four parts of User Experience"></center>
</a>
<span class="caption text-muted">Four parts of User Experience.</span>

<ul>
<li><b>Anticipated UX</b> - Even before any interaction, users can imagine how the system and the interaction with it could look like. Thus, it is a vital part of the user experience as it can often motivate users to take some concrete steps in order to get in contact with the system which in business terms would mean to buy the product, however, it is very difficult to influence it as it is dependent from numerous factors which are in its nature highly subjective.</li>
<li><b>Momentary UX</b> - It is being formed during the interaction with the system and it is one of the most critical components, thus, it is not surprisingly that it represents a main focus of many UX designers. Direct interactions with any system can in general be divided in two groups, the ones which evoke positive responses and the others which stimulate negative reactions. Basic example would be when system reacts or it doesn’t react in a way which user has intended.</li>
<li><b>Episodic UX</b> - Experienced directly after usage of the system. It is highly dependent on the momentary UX. It can be seen as an sum (collection) of momentary reactions. Even though it is possible for a system to behave in unexpected way, it is very important to minimize such events and concentrate that the user is left with mostly positive experiences, because if done properly, this part of UX will encourage repeated interaction with the system over time.</li>
<li><b>Cumulative UX</b> - It forms after longer time span of usage and after multiple episodic experiences. In a same way how momentary experiences influence episodic evaluation, episodic experiences influence overall cumulative experience. In a way this part of the user experience covers all other three parts but compared to them it is much more difficult to measure as it requires the most extensive research methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I was the only researchers in the study and the study itself had a limited time span I focused only on momentary UX and a cumulative UX which from my personal experience were the most insightful and most revealing. Momentary UX explains how many positive emotions are evoked during the interaction with the system and Cumulative UX in short explains what do the user feel about the system when it is considered as a whole.
What I discovered is that playing both of the games leaves people with positive feelings afterwards. However, these levels of positive emotions were so much surprisingly expressed in the AR game as can be seen below.</p>

<p>Therefore, even though the game mechanics of Pokemon GO and my own developed game are inherently different It can still be argued that the success of the Pokemon might lie in its superior user experience which Augmented Reality brings.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that to have a successful game you just need to make it in AR. People who catch Pokemons around also do it because of the anticipated User Experience i.e. some of them just probably want to re-expereince the feelings of their childhood and the app allows them to do just that. It is also very unlikely that the same viral success would happen with an unknown or new cartoon franchise.</p>


<p>Whatever is the case, I think the world of Augmented Gaming just started with the Pokemon Go craze and it is very unlikely that is going to stop with it. For anybody interested my latest idea with Augmented Reality is the game for kids where they have their own holographic human and watch how his life unfolds right in front of their eyes, they also develop its skills through numerous mini games and take care of its personal needs.

<p>To conclude, this research allowed me to dig deeper into the user experience which with no-doubt is what differentiates good companies from the superb ones in the ever increasing consumer-demanding 21st century. As a matter of a fact, even though I used it in the gaming context, the UX concepts described in this post can be applied to almost every product or service out there.</p>
